Use HTML5 Boilerplate to setup basic html\r\n2. Play with navigator.geolocation \r\n3. ????\r\n4. Advertising Revenue!\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\nWell, I was going to build an iOS app, but then I thought I could get\r\n90% of the way there via JS and a static web page.\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\n1. Be able to see a map of your current location\r\n2. Be able to drop a pin on your current location and add a description\r\n3. Be able to refresh the page and retain your dropped pins without a\r\n   web-server-backed store.\r\n4. Figure out the ins and outs of app caching via a manifest file.\r\n\r\n## How's it going?\r\nSo far so good. It's a work in progress, and I still have a lot of\r\ntinkering and refactoring to do. I want to make a nice api out of it so\r\nit could be useful for some of my other projects. It's not there yet.\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
