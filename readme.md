# geocacher.js

Just playing around with browser's navigator.geolocation.

1. Use HTML5 Boilerplate to setup basic html
2. Play with navigator.geolocation 
3. ????
4. Advertising Revenue!

## Why?
Well, I was going to build an iOS app, but then I thought I could get
90% of the way there via JS and a static web page.

## Goals
1. Be able to see a map of your current location
2. Be able to drop a pin on your current location and add a description
3. Be able to refresh the page and retain your dropped pins without a
   web-server-backed store.
4. Figure out the ins and outs of app caching via a manifest file.

## How's it going?
So far so good. It's a work in progress, and I still have a lot of
tinkering and refactoring to do. I want to make a nice api out of it so
it could be useful for some of my other projects. It's not there yet.
